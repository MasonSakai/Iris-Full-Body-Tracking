Use this type of indication for calibration?

Make a button detection button
Press the UI button, wait for no input, then take the next controller button pressed

Make it a proper driver/addon!

double check camera pixel to ray calculations (RBE2002, week6-visual-cues-2)

Stored configuration and position data (so they should only need to be recentered)
Add a recenter, then select which camera to use (or invert the logic, so default is recenter unless the camera isn't calibrated)

Make it work with existing trackers?
